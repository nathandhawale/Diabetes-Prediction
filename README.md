Predicting Diabetes
Created a Web App that Predicts Diabetes

I started with analyzing the data first the creating the training and testing sets. I then standardized the datam then transformed it before running an SVM model to predict the accuracy. The training set had a score 78.6% and the testing set had a score of 77.2% I then again built a predictive system to determine the accuracy of the code.

I then created a web app using streamlit for users to enter in information to determine whether or not they are positive or negative for Diabetes.
